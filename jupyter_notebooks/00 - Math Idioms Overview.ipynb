    "# Overview of Common Mathematical Idioms\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an overview of the most common idioms used in math lectures, especially for reading mathematical expressions and equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Fractions\n",
    "- **$ \\frac{a}{b} $** is often read as:\n",
    "  - \"a over b\" (informal)\n",
    "  - \"a divided by b\" (formal)\n",
    "  - \"the ratio of a to b\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: $ \\frac{3}{5} $ is read as \"three over five\" or \"three divided by five.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Exponents and Powers\n",
    "- **$ a^b $** is typically read as:\n",
    "  - \"a to the power of b\" (formal)\n",
    "  - \"a to the b\" (more casual)\n",
    "  - \"a squared\" (if $ b = 2 $)\n",
    "  - \"a cubed\" (if $ b = 3 $)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: $ 2^3 $ is read as \"two to the power of three\" or \"two cubed.\"\n",

    "  - \"the cube root of a\" (if $ n = 3 $)\n",
    "\n",

    "## 6. Differences\n",
    "- **$ a - b $** is read as:\n",
    "  - \"a minus b\"\n",
    "  - \"the difference between a and b\"\n",
    "  - \"a, b difference\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Equation Operations\n",
    "- **Subtraction**: When modifying an equation, one might say:\n",
    "  - \"subtract x from the equation\"\n",
    "  - \"subtract x from both sides\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \"Subtract 2 from the equation to isolate the variable.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Substitution**:\n",
    "  - \"substitute x into the equation\"\n",
    "  - \"plug x in\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \"Substitute $x = 3$ into the equation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Term References\n",
    "- Terms within an equation or expression are often referred to casually as \"guys\" or \"terms.\"\n",
    "  - \"This guy here is multiplied by 2.\"\n",
    "  - \"Now we work with the second term.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. Derivatives\n",

    "\n",
    "## 14. Combinatorics\n",
    "- **$ \\binom{n}{k} $** is read as:\n",
    "  - \"n choose k\"\n",
    "  - \"the combination of n taken k at a time\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: $ \\binom{5}{2} $ is read as \"five choose two.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 16. Absolute Value\n",
    "- **$ |a| $** is read as:\n",
    "  - \"the absolute value of a\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: $ |-3| $ is read as \"the absolute value of negative three.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 17. Set Notation\n",
    "- **$ \\{ a, b, c \\} $** is read as:\n",
    "  - \"the set containing a, b, and c\"\n",

    "  - \"the empty set\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: $ \\{1, 2\\} \\cup \\{2, 3\\} $ is read as \"the union of the set containing 1 and 2 and the set containing 2 and 3.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 18. Logical Statements\n",
    "- **$ \\forall x $** is read as:\n",
    "  - \"for all x\"\n",
    "- **$ \\exists x $** is read as:\n",
    "  - \"there exists an x\"\n",
    "- **$ P \\implies Q $** is read as:\n",
    "  - \"P implies Q\"\n",
    "- **$ P \\iff Q $** is read as:\n",
    "  - \"P if and only if Q\", sometimes \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: $ \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}, x^2 \\geq 0 $ is read as \"for all x in the real numbers, x squared is greater than or equal to zero.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 19. Mini-Dictionary of Mathematical Idioms\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"a times b\"**: Used to describe multiplication. Example: \"To simplify the equation, we calculate a times b.\"\n",
    "- **\"Subtract x from the equation\"**: Refers to subtracting a term from both sides. Example: \"Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the variable.\"\n",
    "- **\"Substitute\" or \"Plug in\"**: Refers to replacing a variable with a value. Example: \"Substitute $x = 2$ into the equation.\"\n",
    "- **\"This guy here\"**: A casual way to refer to a specific part of the equation. Example: \"Now this guy here is what we need to simplify.\"\n",
    "- **\"Term\"**: Refers to individual elements in an expression. Example: \"Let's collect like terms on both sides.\"\n"
