## Directories

- `jupyter notebooks` : translation of the Czech text book with added Python plots and calculations
- `skripta` : the Czech text book

## Getting Jupyter Notebooks to Live
Only static render of the Jupyter notebooks is presented on GitHub. To make them interactive
install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and then open the lecture notebooks using the JupyterLab application from the Anaconda navigator.
See instruction [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISqEwk9nB_Y).
